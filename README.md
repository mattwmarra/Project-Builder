# Problems I Faced During Development
- Creating a database in 3rd normal form using a nonrelational database was difficult to learn, but was overcome by growing an understanding of MongoDB's aggregation pipelines
- Implemented redux late in the project which required a lot of reworking functions

# Things To Be Implemented
- ~Kanban board~
- Budget tracking
- User Accounts
