# Project Builder
This is a React App designed to create and manage projects using a Kanban board. 

# What I Used
* ReactJS
* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* react-beautiful-dnd 

# Problems I Faced During Development
- Creating a database in 3rd normal form using a nonrelational database was difficult to learn, but was overcome by growing an understanding of MongoDB's aggregation pipelines
- Implemented redux late in the project which required a lot of reworking functions

# Things To Be Implemented
- ~Kanban board~
- Budget tracking
- Establish dependencies between tasks so that an order of operation can be seen
